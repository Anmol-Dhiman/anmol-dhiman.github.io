# [EIP-7691: Blob throughput increase](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691)

## Why this EIP neeeded?

- Ethereum is scaling through a rollup-centric roadmap.
- The [Dencun upgrade](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#dencun) introduced blobs ([EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)), and initial monitoring showed network stability with the new gas target and a decrease in re-org rates.
- The inclusion of the `IDONTWANT` message in Gossipsub (Ethereum's p2p messaging protocol) reduces unnecessary data transmission, saving network bandwidth.
- This EIP aims to support Ethereum's scaling until more efficient solutions are developed like `peerDAS`, with blob size adjustments based on network stability post-Dencun.

## EIP Proposal and Functioning

- Introducing the following fields :

| Title                                | Value   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK_ELECTRA          | 9       |
| TARGET_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK_ELECTRA       | 6       |
| MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK               | 1179648 |
| TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK            | 786432  |
| BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PRAGUE | 3338477 |

- At **PECTRA_FORK_EPOCH**, the **consensus layer clients** will use `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK_ELECTRA` and `TARGET_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK_ELECTRA`.
- At **PECTRA_FORK_EPOCH**, the **execution layer** will use `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK`, `TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK`, and `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PRAGUE`.
- `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK` and `TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK` will replace their counterparts from **EIP-4844**.
- `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PRAGUE` will replace `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION` from **EIP-4844**.

### Impact on Blob Base Fee Adjustments

In each block, there are two possible scenarios:

### **Before EIP-7691**

- The **target-to-max blob ratio** was **1:2**.
- If the block contained **full blobs** (reaching max capacity), the **blob base fee** increased by **~12.5%**.
- If there were **no blobs** in the block, the **blob base fee** decreased by **~11.1%**.
- This mechanism encouraged users to store data in blobs when demand was low.

### **After EIP-7691**

- The **target-to-max blob ratio** changed to **2:3**.
- With **full blobs**, the **blob base fee** now increases by **~8.2%** (previously ~12.5%).
- If there are **no blobs**, the **blob base fee** now decreases by **~14.5%** (previously ~11.1%).
- This adjustment is driven by the introduction of specific value of **`BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PRAGUE`**, which ensures a more balanced response to blob usage.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risks

1.  Increased network bandwidth usage, especially for validators with limited resources.
2.  The fork could cause temporary network congestion.

### Mitigations

1.  Conduct simulations on both mainnet and testnet to test large blocks and blobs.
2.  Monitor the network closely during the fork to identify and address potential issues.
