# [EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623)

## Why this EIP neeeded?

- The current calldata cost allows a maximum block size of **7.15 MB**, while the average block size remains around **100 KB**.
- The goal is to **reduce the maximum calldata usage** by increasing its cost.
- This primarily impacts **data-centric applications** that rely on storing large amounts of data on-chain.
- Raising calldata costs makes **heavy calldata transactions more expensive**, discouraging their use and creating **room for more blobs and regular transactions**, which could eventually lead to an **increase in the block gas limit**.
- Since the **block gas limit hasn’t increased since EIP-1559** and **calldata costs have remained unchanged since EIP-2028**, EIP-4844 introduces **blobs** as a more efficient alternative for data availability.
- Because calldata remains **permanently stored on-chain**, it should be **deprioritized** in favor of **blobs**, which provide a more scalable solution.

## EIP Proposal and Functioning

### Introducing the Following Fields

| Parameter                    | Value |
| ---------------------------- | ----- |
| `STANDARD_TOKEN_COST`        | 4     |
| `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN` | 10    |

### Current Gas Calculation Formula

The total gas usage for a transaction is currently determined by:

```solidity
tx.gasUsed = (
    21000
    + STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * tokens_in_calldata
    + execution_gas_used
    + isContractCreation * (32000 + INITCODE_WORD_COST * words(calldata))
)
```

- Calldata Cost:

  - `0x00` bytes → 4 gas
  - `0x01` - `0xFF` bytes → 16 gas

- Where:
  - `21000` → Base gas cost for updating the sender's nonce.
  - `tokens_in_calldata` → zero_bytes_in_calldata + (nonzero_bytes_in_calldata \* 4).
  - `isContractCreation` → Boolean indicating if a contract is being created.
  - `execution_gas_used` → Gas required for executing opcodes in the transaction.
  - `INITCODE_WORD_COST` → 2 gas (as per EIP-3860).

### Updated Gas Calculation Formula

```solidity!
tx.gasUsed = (
    21000
    +
    max(
        STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * tokens_in_calldata
        + execution_gas_used
        + isContractCreation * (32000 + INITCODE_WORD_COST * words(calldata)),
        TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN * tokens_in_calldata
    )
)
```

### Effects

- The increase in calldata costs reduces the maximum possible block size, making room for more transactions and blobs introduced in EIP-4844.
- Data-centric applications relying heavily on calldata for on-chain storage will face higher costs.
- Encourages the use of blobs instead of calldata for data availability, aligning with Ethereum's scalability goals.

### Key Changes

#### Before this EIP:

- **Zero bytes (`0x00`) cost** → **4 gas**
- **Non-zero bytes (`0x01 - 0xFF`) cost** → **16 gas**

#### After this EIP:

- **Zero bytes (`0x00`) cost** → **10 gas**
- **Non-zero bytes (`0x01 - 0xFF`) cost** → **40 gas**

### Implementation Considerations

- **Wallets & node software** must update their **gas estimation logic** to incorporate `TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN`.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risks

1. Wallets and node operators must update their gas estimation logic; failure to do so may result in transaction failures and unnecessary gas expenditure.

### Mitigation

1. Implement the updated gas estimation formula in the codebase.
