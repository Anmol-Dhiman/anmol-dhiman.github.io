# [EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7549)

## Why this EIP needed?
1. **Validators Cast Their Votes by Signing a Message Containing:**  
   - **LMD GHOST Vote**: `(beacon_block_root, slot)`   [explained below]
   - **Casper FFG Vote**: `(source, target)`   [explained below]
   - **Committee Index**: `(index)`, which identifies the validator's assigned committee  

2. **Aggregation Within the Same Committee**  
   - All validators in the same committee sign the same attestation message, where all fields remain identical.  
   - Their votes can be aggregated into a single signature.  
   - Their public keys can also be aggregated for verification using the **BLS12-381** signature scheme at the **Beacon Chain (Consensus Layer)**.  

3. **Limitation of Cross-Committee Aggregation**  
   - Validators from different committees have distinct **committee index** values.  
   - Since the **committee index** differs, aggregated votes from different committees **cannot be merged further**.  
   - This results in separate verification for each committee on the Beacon Chain.  

4. **Verification Complexity and Costs**  
   - For **N** validators spread across **K** different committees, the number of required signature verifications was: 
`O(K) (oneÂ verificationÂ perÂ committee)`
   - This led to **higher verification costs**.  



### **Casper FFG** finalizes blocks at fixed intervals.  
  - Each **epoch (32 slots â†’ new block proposal each slot)** includes a **checkpoint block** that validators vote on.  
  - A block is **justified** if it receives at least **2/3 of validator votes** within the epoch.  
  - **Finalization rule:** When a new checkpoint is justified, the **previous justified checkpoint gets finalized**.  
  - `source`  â†’ The most recent **justified block**.  
  - `target` â†’ The new block they want to **justify in the future**.  

| Epoch   | Checkpoint | Status                        |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| X       | A         | Justified âœ…                  |
| X+1     | B         | Justified & A Finalized ðŸ”¥   |
| X+2     | C         | Justified & B Finalized      |

| Epoch   | **Source Vote** (Most Recent Justified) | **Target Vote** (New Checkpoint to Justify) |
|---------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| X+1     | A                               | B                                |
| X+2     | B                               | C                                |
| X+3     | C                               | D (next checkpoint)              |



### LMD GHOST (Latest Message Driven Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree)  

LMD GHOST is a fork-choice rule used in Ethereumâ€™s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. It helps resolve situations where multiple blocks are produced simultaneously, leading to a fork in the chain.  

- Validators vote for the block they consider the best candidate for the chain head, based on their **latest justified checkpoint**.  
- Each validator's vote includes:  
  -  `beacon_block_root`  â†’ The block hash of the new block they believe should be the head of the chain.  
  - `slot` â†’ The current slot number in which the vote is cast.  
- The chain follows the **heaviest subtree**, meaning the branch with the highest total validator stake backing it is chosen as the canonical chain.  





## EIP Proposal and Functioning
- The goal of this EIP is to remove the **Committee index (`index`)** from the **Attestation message container**, allowing **cross-committee signature aggregation and verification** at the **Beacon Chain**. This optimization reduces the verification complexity to **O(1)**.

### **Consensus Layer (CL) Changes**  
- Set the **index** field in `AttestationData` to a fixed value of **zero**.  
- Move **committee indexing data** to the outer `Attestation` container using `committee_bits`.  
- Expand the **aggregation_bits** capacity to cover **all committees within a slot**.  


```javascript!
class AttestationData(Container):
    slot: Slot
    index: CommitteeIndex -> 0 //going to set 0 
    # LMD GHOST vote
    beacon_block_root: Root
    # FFG vote
    source: Checkpoint
    target: Checkpoint
```

```javascript!
class Attestation(Container):
    aggregation_bits: Bitlist[MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_COMMITTEE * MAX_COMMITTEES_PER_SLOT]  # [Modified in Electra:EIP7549]
    data: AttestationData
    committee_bits: Bitvector[MAX_COMMITTEES_PER_SLOT]  # [New in Electra:EIP7549]
    signature: BLSSignature
```

### Deprecation strategy

- In each slot, the maximum number of committees can be **64**.  
- Each attestation from a committee includes a **bitfield** instead of a list of validator IDs.  

### **How the Bitfield Works**  
- Each bit in the bitfield represents a validatorâ€™s participation:  
  - `1` â†’ Validator participated in the attestation.  
  - `0` â†’ Validator did not participate.  

Example:  

|   |   |  
| -------- | -------- |  
| Bitfield     | 10110110     |  
| Indexes     | 01234567     |  




- Validators **0, 2, 3, 5, and 6** have attested (voted).  
- Validators **1, 4, and 7** have not attested.  

### **Why `MAX_ATTESTATIONS` is Reduced**  
- Since attestations from all committees are aggregated, the **bitfield size increases by 64 times**.  
- To manage this increase in size, the maximum number of attestations included in a beacon block (`MAX_ATTESTATIONS`) is reduced:  
  - Previously: **128** attestations per block ([Phase 0](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/2c1f677187e6534aec77057a7d1cc746a40d3630/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#max-operations-per-block)).  
  - Now: **8** attestations per block ([Electra Upgrade](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/2c1f677187e6534aec77057a7d1cc746a40d3630/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#execution)).  

### **Impact on Voting Capacity**  
- Even though fewer attestations are included per block, each attestation now represents **aggregated** votes from multiple committees.  
- This change increases the **total number of votes recorded per block by 4 times** compared to the previous system, which stored individual attestations separately.  
- The new approach optimizes storage while increasing overall voting efficiency.  



### why `MAX_ATTESTER_SLASHINGS` is Reduced
- Due to the aggregation of attestations across committees, the size of each attestation has increased **64 times**.  
- In a network with **1 million validators**, the worst-case size of a single **AttesterSlashing** per block is:  
  - **488 KB (uncompressed)**  
  - **320 KB (compressed using Snappy)** â€“ still significantly large!  
- To prevent excessive block sizes, the **MAX_ATTESTER_SLASHINGS** per block has been reduced from **2 to 1**.  

## Risks & Mitigations


### Risks
1. A change in the Attestation container could render attestations invalid after a fork, potentially leading to validators being penalized for going offline.
2. If the implementation fails to verify the attestation signature before registering it on the P2P gossip network, there is a risk of cache pollution.


### Mitigations
1. Develop a system that ensures attestations remain valid across forks.
2. Verify the attestation signature before registering it to prevent invalid data from polluting the cache.
