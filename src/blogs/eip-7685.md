# [EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685)

> This is a foundational EIP that will serve as a basis for future EIPs, enabling further standardization of `request_type`.

## Why this EIP neeeded?
- Currently, communication between the Execution Layer (EL) and Consensus Layer (CL) is limited to block creation and attestation.

One problem is, to become a validator in the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, a node operator must send 32 ETH to the smart contract [0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa#code). This transaction is processed like a regular transaction, and the CL continuously monitors the contract's state to update the validator list whenever a new entry appears. However, exiting as a validator requires a manual request sent directly to the CL.

This EIP aims to standardize requests from the Execution Layer (EL) to the Consensus Layer (CL) using smart contract events, eliminating intermediaries and manual processes.


## EIP Proposal and Functioning
A request object consists of:  
- **`request_type`** – Defines the type of request.  
- **`request_data`** – A raw bytes array ( opaque byte data because this allows `request_data` to be formatted into different encoding schemes in the future, such as **SSZ** or **LEB128**. ).  

The request structure is represented as:  
`request = request_type ++ request_data`

A new **32-byte value** called `requests_hash` is added to the block header. This represents the **hash of all requests** in that block.


### Request Hash Calculation  

1. A list of all requests is created.  
2. Requests with **empty `request_data`** are **excluded** to prevent identical hashes that could cause collisions in block with same `request_type` and empty `request_data`.  
3. The remaining **`request_type` values are sorted in ascending order**.  
4. A **SHA-256 hash** of the ordered list is computed to generate the `requests_hash`.

*Note:* Within the same `request_type`, the **order of requests is not defined** in this EIP.


### Request Generation and Validation  

### Source of Requests  
Requests originate from **transactions executed on the EL smart contract** i.e. an EOA. The contract:  
- Stores the **request object**.  
- Emits an **event** to propagate the request.  

### Validation Process  
- Full validation **is not possible** on the **Execution Layer (EL)**.  
- The EL contract performs **possible validations** before emitting the request event.  
- Complete validation occurs on the **Consensus Layer (CL)** when processing the request.  


## Risks & Mitigations


### Risks

1. There is no standardized method for handling requests within the same type, which may result in unintended behavior.
2. Since the Execution Layer (EL) lacks proper validation, an attacker could flood the Consensus Layer (CL) with invalid requests, potentially causing network congestion.


### Mitigations

1. Establish a standardized approach for handling intra-type requests.
2. Implement validation on the Execution Layer (EL) to filter out faulty requests before they reach the Consensus Layer (CL).
