# [EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)

## Before This EIP

Prior to EIP-2718, transactions were simply [RLP-encoded](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) data beginning with values in the range `[0xc0, 0xfe]`, as specified in RLP encoding rules. There was no mechanism to distinguish between different transaction types or handle them uniquely, despite a clear need for such functionality. Without a way to differentiate transactions, establishing rules for their identification would have been complex and prone to errors.

## How This EIP Works

With EIP-2718, a valid transaction is now structured as `TransactionType || TransactionPayload`, and a valid transaction receipt is `TransactionType || ReceiptPayload`.

[ `||` represents the concatenation operator ]

- Here,
  - `TransactionType` is a value in the range `[0, 0x7f]`.
  - `TransactionPayload` and `ReceiptPayload` are [RLP-encoded](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) byte sequences.

Both the transaction type and its associated payload are specified in future EIPs whenever a new transaction type is introduced.

Now, clients (i.e., nodes) can differentiate transactions based on their starting byte:

- If a transaction begins with a value in `[0, 0x7f]`, it is recognized as a typed transaction.
- If it starts with `[0xc0, 0xfe]` (per RLP encoding rules), it is treated as a legacy transaction.

### Inside the Block

- **For Transactions:**  
  `patriciaTrie(rlp(Index) => Transaction)`  
  Where:

  1. `Index` is the transaction’s position within the block.
  2. `Transaction` can be either `TransactionType || TransactionPayload` (for typed transactions) or `LegacyTransaction` (for legacy transactions).
  3. `LegacyTransaction` is an [RLP-encoded](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) payload without a transaction type, starting with `[0xc0, 0xfe]` as per RLP rules, i.e., `rlp([nonce, gasPrice, gasLimit, to, value, data, v, r, s])`.

- **For Receipts:**  
  `patriciaTrie(rlp(Index) => Receipt)`  
  Where:
  1. `Index` is the receipt’s position in the receipt Merkle tree.
  2. `Receipt` can be either `TransactionType || ReceiptPayload` (for typed receipts) or `LegacyReceipt` (for legacy receipts).
  3. `LegacyReceipt` is encoded as `rlp([status, cumulativeGasUsed, logsBloom, logs])`.

Additionally, the `TransactionType` of a receipt **must** match the `TransactionType` of the corresponding transaction with the same `Index`.

## Security Considerations

For any transaction compatible with EIP-2718, users must sign both the type and the payload together. If a user signs only the payload and prepends the type before broadcasting it to the network, the transaction could be interpreted as a legacy transaction. This is a critical requirement—signing both type and payload prevents compatibility with other transaction types, which could otherwise lead to a signature malleability attack.
